What makes a hackathon awesome?
Free food, traveling aside; Hackathons are serious business. You are there to pour your sweat and tears into 24 hrs of intense -- Final Project due tomorrow at 7am oh by the way your harddrive just crashed -- intense coding. Why? Because at the end you know there is a chance to win glory; fat cash prizes or the sweet sweet smell of swag. Many teams fail to accomplish their goal but no one ever leaves unhappy. Everyone learns something. Teams and Clubs grow closer. You may meet new people from different schools or from potential employers. No one leaves without a smile. Thats why I love hackathons.
